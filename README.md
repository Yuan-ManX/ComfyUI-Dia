# ComfyUI-Dia

Make Dia avialbe in ComfyUI.

A TTS model capable of generating ultra-realistic dialogue in one pass.

[Dia](https://github.com/nari-labs/dia) is a 1.6B parameter text to speech model created by Nari Labs. Dia directly generates highly realistic dialogue from a transcript. You can condition the output on audio, enabling emotion and tone control. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughter, coughing, clearing throat, etc.
